            <h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <b>TENEX (TNX)</b> is a decentralised platform operating on the Binance Smart Chain. Tenex began
                as a community coin, 20% of initial supply was airdropped to the community to give all aspiring
                investors fair access to the token and the chance to drive the growth of the project themselves.
                Tenex is a community-driven token with the long-term vision to add real value to our community
                within the DeFi ecosystem.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">Features</h2>
            <p>
                Tenex’s functionality will be the provision of services upon the <b>TNX</b> platform.<br><br>
                The first use case of the Tenex platform will be the lottery function. There will be daily, weekly
                and monthly lotteries, where you risk a small amount of <b>TNX</b> to be in with a chance of winning a
                much larger sized jackpot!
            </p>
            <p>
                We will frequently be giving away Tenex <b>NFTs</b> to top token holders. The greater quantity of
                <b>TNX</b>
                you hold, the increased chance you have of winning an <b>NFT</b> giveaway. Therefore, the growth of
                Tenex will be incentivised firstly through the community’s participation in lotteries. We plan to
                apply for CoinGecko & CoinMarketCap listings once the lottery function goes live on the Tenex
                platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tenex’s long-term objective is to create and operate as an <b>NFT</b> marketplace, where community
                members would use their <b>TNX</b> to buy/sell <b>NFTs</b> and conduct transactions on the <b>TNX</b>
                platform.
                Eventually we plan to offer aspiring digital artists within the Tenex community the opportunity to
                sell their <b>NFTs</b> on the Tenex platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once an <b>NFT</b> marketplace has been established on the Tenex platform, our next goal will be to
                offer an <b>NFT</b> lottery which works in the same manner as the <b>TNX</b> lottery, thus, organically
                incentivising the growth of Tenex’s <b>NFT</b> marketplace through community utilisation.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be no staking/farming pools on the Tenex platform. The reason for this is that there
                exists a running theme of DeFi projects not being able to grow sustainably as liquidity within the
                project dries up over time as APYs diminish. We see this model of high APY farming only being
                sustainable in the short-term, and as a result, it does not align with our long-term vision for
                Tenex.
                Max supply is and always will be capped at 100 million <b>TNX</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tenex operates in-chat polling governance. A proportion of giveaways will be done through polls
                within the Tenex community chat, whereby community members can vote on which <b>NFTs</b> Tenex
                brings to market. Furthermore, the community will be able to vote on proposals surrounding
                Tenex’s future within the chat. Community governance puts the power in the hands of the Tenex
                community with regards to the growth and trajectory of the project in a truly decentralised manner.
                Unlike other projects whereby you need to hold a certain percentage of supply in order to vote on
                proposals - everyone in the Tenex community has the right to vote, regardless of how much <b>TNX</b>
                they hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike many other DeFi projects, Tenex does not claim to be “The Number 1 platform” of
                anything; nevertheless, we will look to continually evolve by adding increased functionality to the
                Tenex platform in a way that directly puts the Tenex community at the forefront of its growth.

                <li>There will be daily, weekly and monthly lotteries with different sized prize funds that will
